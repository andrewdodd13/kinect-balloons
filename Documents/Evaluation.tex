\subsubsection{Procedure}

To extensively evaluate our balloon application with as many participants as possible, the system was set up in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences'  Earl Mountbatten building crush area at Heriot-Watt University from approximately 12.15 p.m. to 2.15 p.m. for five consecutive days, Monday through Friday, in Week 8 of Semester 2.

Before each evaluation session the system was set up using the following equipment:
\begin{itemize}
\item{2 x Microsoft Kinects as the motion sensors used for recognising participants' hand gestures that output video at a frame rate of 30Hz and resolution of 640x480 pixels;}
\item{2 x ?? inch plasma televisions for displaying the balloons and their associated content on screen; }
\item{2 x mid-range laptop computers for the purposes of both to run the devloped balloon client application and one to run the balloon application server that allows balloons to move from one client application to the other.}
\end{itemize}

Every participant invited to be involved in the evaluation session was first presented with a short pre-experiement questionnaire (see appendix \vref{EvalPreQ}) that asked the participant to provide some general information about themselves, including age and gender; if they owned a smartphone that captures Quick Response (QR) codes; if they had any previous experience with motion detection devices like the Kinect; and what they typically use the Earl Mountbatten crush area for.

Upon completing the questionnaire, participants were then taken over to the system where they were allowed to interact with the Kinect by their own free will for however long they chose. Each of the participants were given little to no instruction on how to use the system and were only given subtle hints regarding the capabilities of system if they had difficulties.

Once participants were finished interacting with the system, they were then asked to complete a short post-experiment questionnaire that specifically asked about their ability to use each of the functionalities the system provided, including: pushing balloons, customising balloons and popping balloons to access content; if they felt embarrassed at any point when using gestures to interact with the system; and if they were likely to use the system again in the future.

\subsubsection{Results}

In total, 75 participants were recruited to help evaluate our system and were predominantly students and members of staff from Heriot-Watt University. Of those, 80.0\% (60) were male and 20.0\% (15) were female; 76.0\% (57) were between 16 and 24 years old, 20\% (15) were between 25 and 33 years old, 2.7\% (2) were between 34 and 42 years old, and 1.3\% (1) were between 43 and 51 years old.

With regard to smartphones, it was shown that of the 75 participants who completed the pre-questionnaire, an overwhelming 77.3\% (58) of participants stated that they were currently in possession of a smartphone. Following that, a further 55.2\% (32) of smartphone owners went on to indicate that they did in fact have a Quick Response (QR) code reader application installed on their device. From these statistics it shows that a large majority of people nowadays own a smartphone, therefore providing a strong argument to support the functionality of having QR codes incorporated with the content displayed on screen. And even though some smartphone users may not actually have a QR code reader application installed on their device, they could easily download one in the future if required as it is fair to assume that many of those without one might not have had a justifiable reason to do so at that moment in time.
On the other hand, of the 72 participants who completed the post-questionnaire, 83.3\% (60) of participants admitted to not using a QR code during the time they spent interacting with the system. However, this could perhaps be attributed to participants being unable to pop balloons on screen in order to access content or that participants were pushed for time due to other commitments.

When participants were asked if they had every used any video game related motion detection devices, it was shown that of the 75 participants who had completed the pre-questionnaire, 81.3\% (61) of participants said they did have experience with video game related motion detection devices while 18.7\% (14) said they had not. Of those who responded with having experience with motion detection devices, most stated they were most familiar with using the Nintendo Wii Remote at 88.5\% (54), while quite encouragingly 52.5\% (32) said they had experience with the Microsoft XBox Kinect and 14.8\% (9) had used the Sony PlayStation Move before. Therefore, given by these statistics, it could be hypothesised that participants with prior experience with video game related motion detection devices could easily adapt to interacting with the Kinect balloon application.

This theory can be supported by the results taken from the post-questionnaire where it was shown that 93.0\% (66) of participants were able to intuitively push balloons around screen and 77.8\% (49) of participants were able to intuitively pop a balloon on screen.

An argument to support that the Kinect balloon application should be permanently running on the  plasma screens of the Earl Mountbatten crush area can be derived from the results taken from both the pre-questionnaire and the post-questionnaire. Participants were asked how long they approximately spend in the crush area each day and of the 75 participants, 68\% (51) reponded by stating that they spend less than 20 minutes in the crush area, implying most participants are only in the crush area for a short period of time purposely waiting to attend their next lecture. This can be supported by the response given by the question that asked participants to specify what they typically use the Earl Mountbatten crush area for, where 58.7\% (44) of participants mainly said they generally use the crush area as a waiting area. However, given by the results of post-questionnaire, where 81.9\% (59) of participants stated they would like to play with the balloons again in the future and 70.8\% (51) of participants stated they would like to use it again to view more interesting content, perhaps the the Kinect balloon application would prove generally quite popular as something to quickly interact with to read a news article or having fun with between lectures.

Draft Note: generally quite a messy account of the user evaluation sessions made in week 8 thus so far, things to address are as follows: observations made w.r.t. customising balloons, popping balloons, social factors (including embarrassed users and multiplayer use), group study, and finally some general language issues.

After making the appropriate changes and additions to the application after the initial evaluation, a second evaluation was undertaken which involved students from Utrecht University who were visiting Heriot-Watt whilst on a tour of Europe.

This evaluation was undertaken by members introducing the application to the students on both screens and for another member to make observational notes on their behaviour. In addition, other members were present to discuss and listen to feedback from the students on what they liked and on what could be improved:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Users no longer struggled to understand what to do with the program and were immediately performing basic interactions such as moving and bursting balloons.
	\item Users immediately understood to hold their hand over the X in order to close the content window, and were neither frustrated by the time it took to complete the action, nor confused by accidentally using it.
	\item Users wished to interact with the airplane, by bashing balloons at it with the intention of destroying it.
	\item Users enjoyed multi-user interaction on each screen in addition to interaction with users on a separate screen. Users began their own game where they would try to hoard balloons from the other team's screen in addition to spamming the other screen with all the balloons.
	\item Few users wished to customize balloons, however those that did understood the required actions quickly and did not struggle to do so.
\end{itemize}

In addition, we also received several useful suggestions for future work from the participants:

\begin{itemize}
	\item More balloons were desired from the participants - particularly as they were playing their game in hoarding balloons on each screen.
	\item Users wished to be able to send a message to a twitter account that would then be displayed on a box held by a balloon. This balloon would not hold any content, and so when burst would not display a content box.
	\item In addition to sending a twitter message, users expressed their desire to do the same using Facebook: a user could post to a ``Heriot-Watt Balloons'' Facebook page -- a message that would then display on a balloon. If the user posted content such as a link or photo, this would then display as any regular content, where the balloon could be burst and a QR code would be generated. The image used would be the profile image of the poster.
	\item One user suggested that when bursting twitter balloons, a bird animation should fly out as if just being released.
	\item It was suggested that our QR code could be much simpler. As the code currently contains a lot of unneeded data it is very complex and the user must get close to the screen with their smartphone in order to scan it (also causing a problem of the user's detected hands covering up the code). If we removed this unneeded data the QR Code would be much simpler and therefore could be read from further away. In addition the hand images for users should not be drawn underneath the QR Code. 
\end{itemize}

Finally, a friendly interaction among the users themselves was noted, where users using one screen would shout to users on another screen to pass them balloons. This was a very pleasing observation, as it shows that the program does stimulate friendly engagement -- a concept we were keen to encourage with the program's location being the learning zone.

\subsectionauthor{Future Work}{Lauren Hill \& John Truesdale}

After collaborating all of the data and feedback from user evaluation, in regards to both the results of the evaluation and observation of user behavior, a general consensus of where the application could be improved was agreed upon. The basic concept involved around the integration of a game to the current system but unfortunately due to time constraints was not achievable and therefore is detailed below so that future teams could potentially develop from.

The game would be a social application integrated within the current system that users would begin via a certain gesture or button. It would have the following game modes and would utilize both screens:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Player vs Computer
	\item Player vs Player 
	\item 2 Players vs 1 Player
	\item 2 Players vs 2 Players
\end{enumerate}

In relation to the modes, it would look to incorporate a jump in, jump out feature where users could join and quit as they wished whilst a game was in play and thus have games start at random intervals. If found to be unfeasible it could require users to sign up in order to instigate games against the system or other players. In either case the game's duration would be short, from around 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Once commenced the game would randomly assign a large number of balloons, of varying colours, to both screens and have a very strong wind moving in a random, ever-changing direction. The interaction, and main goal, would be to gain points by completing certain commands or rounds, that is the same for both screens, that randomly appear on screen after a certain duration such as every 5 to 10 seconds. The rounds themselves would be set around getting rid or collecting a particular type of balloon, for example collecting only the red balloons and getting rid of all others. A variation to this could be to have as many balloons on the screen as you can or try to have none at all. The score would be calculated at the end of each round and a player would gain a point for every balloon on their screen that meets the condition and lose a point for not. In terms of the social interaction this would require the user to push and collect balloons on their screen whilst competing with the other player. The difficulty lies in dealing with the large number of fast balloons on your screen which the rounds will require you to constantly manage without much time to think.

This model was constructed entirely from user obervation and feedback and fits nicely within the desired user model for the application. By integrating this aspect into the current system it would allow for the application to address it's main negative feedback and allow for a mix of social interaction and data visualiation.
