The application loads values from a configuration file at start-up, and a default file is created if not file is not found.
The valid options in the configuration file are show below.

\subsection{Common Configuration}

Values present in this category are used by both clients and servers.

\begin{tabular}{|p{5.2cm}|p{2.8cm}|p{7.6cm}|}

\hline Value name & Default value & Comments \\ \hline

LogToConsole & true & Whether log messages are displayed in the console (`stdout') or not.  \\ \hline

LogToFile & false & Whether log messages are written to a file or not. \\ \hline

LogFilePath & null & Path of the file log messages are written to (only if `LogToFile' is true). \\ \hline

InputType & `Mouse' & Which input device to use (`Mouse' or `Kinect'). \\ \hline

SerializerType & `Binary' & Which serialiser to use for network communications (`Binary' or `Text'). \\ \hline

LogNetworkMessages & false & Whether incoming and outgoing messages are logged or not. \\ \hline

BalloonDeadzoneMultiplier & 1.1 & Size (proportional to the size of a balloon) of the deadzone at each side of the screen. Balloons have to move past this zone before changing screens. \\ \hline

LocalIPAddress & 0.0.0.0 & IP address of the interface the server uses to listen for incoming connections. The default value means `any interface'. \\ \hline

LocalPort & 4,000 & Port used to listen for incoming connections. \\ \hline

FeedURL & \emph{See note below} & URL of the Web Feed API. The \verb${0}$ part gets replaced by the number of items to request. \\ \hline

FeedTimeout & 60,000 & Interval of time, in seconds, after which the server should request new items from the feed. \\ \hline

MinBalloonsPerScreen & 1 & Threshold below which the server requests new items from the feed. \\ \hline

MaxBalloonsPerScreen & 5 & Number of feed items (per screen) to request from the feed. \\ \hline

BalloonVelocityLeftX & -10.0 & Initial velocity of a balloon appearing on the right side of the screen (X). \\ \hline

BalloonVelocityLeftY & 0.0 & Initial velocity of a balloon appearing on the right side of the screen (Y). \\ \hline

BalloonVelocityRightX & 10.0 & Initial velocity of a balloon appearing on the left side of the screen (X). \\ \hline

BalloonVelocityRightY & 0.0 & Initial velocity of a balloon appearing on the left side of the screen (Y). \\ \hline

PlaneVelocityLeftX & -2.0 & Initial velocity of a plane going from right to left (X). \\ \hline

PlaneVelocityLeftY & 0.0 & Initial velocity of a plane going from right to left (Y). \\ \hline

PlaneVelocityRightX & 2.0 & Initial velocity of a plane going from left to right (X). \\ \hline

PlaneVelocityRightY & 0.0 & Initial velocity of a plane going from left to right (Y). \\ \hline

PlaneInitialY & 0.5 & Initial, normalised value of a plane's initial Y coordinate on the screen. \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Note}

The default URL of the Web Feed is:\\ \url{http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~cgw4/balloons/index.php/api/getFeed/{0}}

\subsection{Client Configuration (General)}

\begin{tabular}{|p{5.0cm}|p{3.0cm}|p{7.6cm}|}

\hline Value name & Default value & Comments \\ \hline

FullScreen & false & Whether the game should be rendered in full-screen mode. \\ \hline

ScreenWidth & 1,366 & Screen resolution, in pixels (X). \\ \hline

ScreenHeight & 768 & Screen resolution, in pixels (Y). \\ \hline

MessageDisplayTime & 30,000 & How long, in miliseconds, the content box remains on the screen when an user pops a balloon. \\ \hline

PopAnimationTime & 2,500 & Duration, in miliseconds, of the `POW' animation shown when an user pops a balloon. \\ \hline

PopAnimationEnabled & true & Whether the `confetti' animation is shown when an user pops a balloon. \\ \hline

PopAnimationAlpha & 0.3 & `Alpha' parameter of the `POW' animation shown when an user pops a balloon. \newline Controls the amplitude of pulses. \\ \hline

PopAnimationBeta & 5.0 & `Beta' parameter of the `POW' animation shown when an user pops a balloon. \newline Controls the duration of a pulse. \\ \hline

PopAnimationScale & 2.0 & `Scale` parameter of the `POW' animation shown when an user pops a balloon. \\ \hline

UseHtmlRendering & true & Whether text is laid out using HTML or XNA. \\ \hline

RemoteIPAddress & `localhost' & IP address of the server to connect to. \\ \hline

RemotePort & 4,000 & Port of the server to connect to. \\ \hline

\subsection{Client Configuration (Kinect)}

\begin{tabular}{|p{5.0cm}|p{3.0cm}|p{7.6cm}|}

\hline Value name & Default value & Comments \\ \hline

EnableHighFive & false & High five allows two users to pop a balloon by each using a hand to create a clap (i.e. a high five). We decided to disable this because it's actually very hard to do! \\ \hline

KinectMovementThreshold & 2.0 & This is how fast both hands need to be moving for a clap to be triggered. It uses the velocity from the physics object attached to the hands, so the value is in metres/second. \\ \hline

KinectMaxHandRange & 2.0 & This is how far the second hand can be from a balloon to trigger a clap, when the first hand collides with the balloon. Measured in internal metres. \\ \hline

KinectMinAttackAngle & 0.4 & This value ranges from -1 to 1 and is the cosine of the difference in angle allowed between hands and the balloon for triggering a clap. A value of 1 indicates the hand moves move directly at the balloon, 0 allows the hand to be moving parallel to the balloon (90 degrees) and -1 allows the hand to be moving directly away from the balloon. \\ \hline

KinectXSensitivity & 1.5 & This is the horizontal multiplier for the Kinect input. Should be adjusted for each environment to maximize usability. \\ \hline

KinectYSensitivity & 2.0 & This is the vertical multiplier for the Kinect input. Should be adjusted for each environment to maximize usability. Generally this should be bigger than the horizontal multiplier. \\ \hline
