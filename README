Kinect Balloon System
---------------------
The Kinect Balloon System is a project which displays a news feed in a visually
appealing way and lets users interact with the system using a Microsoft Kinect
device.

It is comprised of three parts (currently all of which are mandatory) :-
- The user front-end which displays the balloons and allows users to interact 
  with it using the Kinect system. This part, and the server part below, are in
  the BubblesClient folder.
- The server which fetches news content and organises the layout of the client
  displays. 
- The web application which allows users to submit content, administrators to
  review it and provides the feed script used by the server. This part is in 
  the BubblesPortal folder. 

To-do:
- Screen topology layout (currently each new screen is added in a 
predetermined way).
- Non-networked interface to let the client run standalone
